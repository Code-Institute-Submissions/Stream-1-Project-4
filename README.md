# Stream 1 Project - Photographer's Site

My project is a Photographer's Page to showcase their photos and work to the
public. Users can view a carousel that exhibits some of the best photos. The Gallery
is where the majority of photos can be viewed and a Package Planner where users 
can tailor bespoke packages to their needs. Users can find out about local events
and read testimonials of previous customers.

## UX


### How does it function?

The project uses JQuery for form validation on the package planner and 
testimonials forms which won't be accepted if empty or the wrong patern. There
are also some custom functions for displaying only one form in the package planner

## Technology Used 

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
    - **Bootstrap** gives my project a simple, responsive layout
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - **JQuery** is used to give better UX.
