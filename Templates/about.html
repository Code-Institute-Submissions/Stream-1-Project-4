						<h4 class="card-title">About Me</h4>
						<p class="card-text">Following a successful career in graphic design I started my own business and began my journey as an event photographer 15 years ago. Since then I have expanded into wedding photography and portrait work.  As a photographer my role is to be an unseen presence at your event, capturing the beautiful natural moments and memorializing your event in a personal and professional way.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I offer multiple fixed packages and also a bespoke package, so that we can meet your every need. For larger events I can recommend a second photographer to ensure that we capture the essence of the whole event.</p>
